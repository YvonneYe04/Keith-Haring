    <h2>The Early Beginnings: 1958-1978</h2>
    <p>
      Keith Haring's journey into the art world began with his birth on May 4, 1958,
      in Reading, Pennsylvania. Growing up in nearby Kutztown, Haring developed a
      fascination with art from a young age, influenced by his father, an amateur
      cartoonist. His early exposure to cartoon art would later become a significant
      element in his own work. The late 1970s marked a pivotal moment for Haring
      when he moved to New York City to attend the School of Visual Arts (SVA). This
      period not only honed his artistic skills but also immersed him in the vibrant
      street culture of the city, which would become a central theme in his art.

    <h2>Art Style: The Visual Language of Keith Haring</h2>
    <p>
        Keith Haring's art style is immediately recognizable for its vibrant, dynamic
        figures and a sense of movement and energy. Drawing inspiration from graffiti,
        pop art, and Egyptian hieroglyphics, Haring developed a unique visual language
        that communicated complex messages in an accessible way. His work often
        featured recurring motifs, such as barking dogs, flying saucers, and dancing
        figures, each symbolizing different themes or social issues. Haring's ability
        to combine form and function, art and message, set him apart as an artist who
        not only captured the zeitgeist of his time but also used his canvas as a tool
        for change.

    <h2>The Subway Drawings: 1980-1985</h2>
    <p>
      By the early 1980s, Keith Haring had found his canvas in the unused
      advertising spaces of New York City's subway stations. Using white chalk on
      the black matte paper backgrounds, Haring created hundreds of these public
      artworks, characterized by their bold lines, vivid colors, and kinetic
      figures. This period was significant for Haring, as the subway drawings helped
      to democratize art, making it accessible to the everyday commuter. His art was
      not confined to the galleries; it was a part of the urban landscape,
      reflecting the city's dynamic energy and diverse population.
